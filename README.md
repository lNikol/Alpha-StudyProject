# StudyProject
My experience of creating an alpha version of an application similar to <a href='https://quizlet.com'>quizlet</a> and <a href='https://studysmarter.de'>studySmarter</a>

Backend implements REST API, authorization and authentication using JWT-tokens, all data (about the user, about the files), are in a remote in MongoDB
